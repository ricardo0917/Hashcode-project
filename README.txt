HashTables

to run the program without IDE, Find the following addresses in Program Files, copy and paste them in quotes ""
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk-14.0.1\bin\javac"
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk-14.0.1\bin\java"
in the compile.bat file I'll leave you there, and next to javac write the name of the class to be executed, that is HashCode.java,
next to java write only HashCode, save as compile.bat and run it if it doesn't give you any error press Enter and should run the program.

it would be like this: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk-14.0.1\bin\javac" HashCode.java
                       pause
                       "C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk-14.0.1\bin\java" Hashcode
		       pause
